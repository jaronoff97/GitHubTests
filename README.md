# GitHubTests
This is a test for people to learn how to use github, we're going to be learning how to push, pull, and branch a git repo


<p>To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need a repository for it to live in. Let's create one!</p>

</div>

<p>On GitHub, you can store all kinds of projects in <em><a href="/articles/github-glossary#repository">repositories</a></em>. Personal repositories belong to <em>user accounts</em>, so after you've <a href="/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">signed up for GitHub</a>, you can create your first repository!</p>

<h3>
<a name="create-a-new-repository-on-github" class="anchor" href="#create-a-new-repository-on-github"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Create a new repository on GitHub</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>In the upper-right corner of any page, click <span class="octicon octicon-plus" aria-label="Plus symbol " title="Plus symbol "></span>, and then click <strong>New repository</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".</p></li>
<li>Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
</li>
<li>Choose between creating a <em>public</em> or <em>private</em> repository.

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Public</strong> repositories are a great choice for getting started! They're visible to any user on GitHub, so you can benefit from a collaborative community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Private</strong> repositories require a little more setup. They're only available to you, the <em>repository owner</em>, as well as any <em>collaborators</em> you choose to share with. Private repositories are only available for paid accounts. For more information, see "<a href="/articles/what-plan-should-i-choose">What plan should I choose?</a>."
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select <strong>Initialize this repository with a README</strong>.
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Create repository</strong>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a <em>README</em> file.</p>

<h3>
<a name="commit-your-first-change" class="anchor" href="#commit-your-first-change"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commit your first change</h3>

<p>A <em><a href="/articles/github-glossary#commit">commit</a></em> is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.</p>

<p>When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a <em>README</em> file. <em>README</em> files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your <em>README</em> file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.</p>

<p>Let's commit a change to the <em>README</em> file.</p>

<ol>
<li>In your repository's list of files, click <strong><em>README.md</em></strong>.
</li>
<li>Above the file's content, click <span class="octicon octicon-pencil" aria-label="The edit icon " title="The edit icon "></span>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Edit file</strong> tab
, type some information about yourself.
</li>
<li><p>Above the new content, click <strong>Preview changes</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.</p></li>
<li><p>At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is <code>master</code>, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then <a href="/articles/creating-a-pull-request">create a pull request</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Propose file change</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
